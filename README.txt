My game is Tic-Tac-Toe, which is more complete and more focus on UI
than the sample.

My game is composed of 3 activities
The first one is the welcome, in this view, two players can type in their names and click
 the start button to start the game.

Then the game view, in this view there is a instruction bar at the top to
tell the user whose term it is. And below the bar is the grids for the 
Tic-Tac-Toe.

When one of the player wins or the game ties, it will automatically bring
the players to the last view, where "congrats" or "tie game" will be
presented correspondingly, and there is also a "new game" button for user
to click to start a new game which is go back to the beginning interface.
